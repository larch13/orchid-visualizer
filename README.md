## 📋 Prerequisites

- Docker (recommended)
- Node.js 18.x or later (alternative)
- npm 10.x or later (alternative)

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 🐳 Docker Development (Recommended)

We recommend using Docker for development to ensure a consistent environment across all platforms:

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SynthSonic/orchid-visualizer.git
cd orchid
```

2. Build and start the Docker container
```bash
docker-compose up
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. Any changes to your code will automatically be reflected in real-time thanks to the configured hot reloading.

To stop the container:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

#### Docker Commands

```bash
docker-compose up            # Start the development environment
docker-compose up --build    # Rebuild and start (use after package.json changes)
docker-compose down          # Stop the development environment
docker exec -it orchid-visualizer npm run lint        # Run linting inside the container
docker exec -it orchid-visualizer npm run typecheck   # Run type checking inside the container
docker exec -it orchid-visualizer npm run format:check   # Run type checking inside the container
```

### Alternative: Standard Installation

If you prefer not to use Docker, you can set up the project directly on your system:

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/orchid.git
cd orchid
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Copy the example environment file
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Update the environment variables in `.env` with your values

5. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
npm run typecheck    # Run TypeScript checks
npm run lint        # Run ESLint
npm run format:check # Check code formatting
```

## 🚀 Deployment
